In this repository there is simple examples of Python code.
They are categorized by the following topics:
- [Variables and Types](variables.py)
- [Conditions](conditions.py)
- [Loops](loops.py)
- [Functions](functions.py)
***
- [Example how to make a menu in python](testar.py)
- [Small example with PyGame](pygame1.py)
- [Small example with CustomTKinter](win.py) 

## Python as a first language
Python is a great language to start programming. It is easy to learn and has a lot of libraries that can help you to do a lot of things.
If you are starting to learn programming, I recommend you to start with Python. It is a great language to learn the basics of programming.
Python differs on several points from other languages, but it is a great language to start with.
Here are some deifferences:
- Python is an interpreted language, which means that you don't need to compile your code before running it.
- Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable before using it.
- Python is a high-level language, which means that you don't need to worry about the details of the machine you are running your code on.
- Python is a general-purpose language, which means that you can use it to do a lot of things.
- Python is a language that is easy to learn, which means that you can start programming in Python without having to learn a lot of things first.
- Python is a language that is easy to read, which means that you can understand what a piece of code does without having to read a lot of documentation.
- The intendation is very important in Python, which means that you need to be careful with the spaces and tabs in your code.

## Why not C# or Java?
C# and Java are great languages, but they are not as easy to learn as Python. They have a lot of features that can make it difficult for beginners to learn programming.
Here are some
- C# and Java are compiled languages, which means that you need to compile your code before running it.
- C# and Java are statically typed languages, which means that you need to declare the type of a variable before using it.
- C# and Java are low-level languages, which means that you need to worry about the details of the machine you are running your code on.
- C# and Java are languages that are not as easy to learn as Python, which means that you need to learn a lot of things before you can start programming.
- C# and Java are languages that are not as easy to read as Python, which means that you need to read a lot of documentation to understand what a piece of code does.
- C# and Java are languages that are not as easy to write as Python, which means that you need to write a lot of code to do simple things.
- C# and Java are languages that are not as easy to debug as Python, which means that you need to spend a lot of time fixing bugs in your code.
- C# and Java are languages that are not as easy to maintain as Python, which means that you need to spend a lot of time refactoring your code.
